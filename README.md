## Genomic epidemiology of the 2018-2021 Nord Kivu, DRC Ebola epidemic

This is the [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) build for Nord Kivu Ebola, visible at https://nextstrain.org/community/inrb-drc/ebola-nord-kivu

This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data by research groups.
These sequences were generated by the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sequencing Consortium led by the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicales (INRB), Kinshasa, DRC, partnered with the United States Army Medical Reseach Insititute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Maryland, USA; University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Nebraska, USA; Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Dakar, Senegal; TransVIHMI, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Université de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.

These data were shared with the Ministry of Health of the DRC, and with the public via this [virological.org](http://virological.org/t/drc-2018-viral-genome-characterization/230) post. If you intend to use these sequences prior to publication, please contact Drs. Muyembe-Tamfum and Ahuka to coordinate.
